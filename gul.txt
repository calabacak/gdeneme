Merge conflicts can be an intimidating experience.
Luckily, Git offers powerful tools to help navigate and resolve conflicts.
Git can handle most merges on its own with automatic merging features.
There are many tools to help resolve merge conflicts. Git has plenty of command line tools we discussed here. For more detailed information on these tools visit stand-alone pages for git log, git reset, git status, git checkout, and git reset. In addition to the Git, many third-party tools offer streamlined merge conflict support features.
A conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.
